### Movie Revenue Dashboard in Excel
This project involves working with an Excel dataset to perform various tasks, such as formatting the table to make it look more professional, aggregating data, creating charts, and using Pivot Tables to summarize data. The aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in working with Excel and performing common data analysis tasks.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is an Excel file containing information about movies, including the movie name, distributor, genre, and monthly revenue for each movie over a period of several months.

#### Requirements
In order to complete this project, you will need a working copy of Microsoft Excel. The instructions provided assume a basic familiarity with Excel, including how to open and navigate a workbook, select cells, and use basic formulas and functions.

#### Instructions
1. Open the Excel file containing the dataset.
2. Format the table to make it look more professional, including adding column headings, adjusting column widths, and applying a table style.
3. Create column and row totals for the revenue data using the SUM function.
4. Create an Average, Min, and Max column for the revenue data using the appropriate functions.
5. Create a Month over Month column for the latest month using the appropriate formulas.
6. Conditional format the Month over Month column to highlight positive and negative changes using a color scale.
7. Sort the data by Totals in descending order.
8. Create a new column that displays "Above Average" or "Below Average" depending on whether the Total value for each row is above or below the overall average revenue value.
9. Join the Distributor column from part 2 with the existing table. This new column should be second (next to the Movie column).
10. Create a Pivot Table that shows the Sum and Average revenue values for each distributor.
11. Create a horizontal bar chart that shows the Total revenue values for each movie.
12. Create a vertical bar chart that shows the Average revenue values for each genre.
13. Create a pie chart that shows the Average revenue values for each distributor.

#### Conclusion
This project has demonstrated several common data analysis tasks using Microsoft Excel, including formatting tables, aggregating data, using Pivot Tables to summarize data, and creating charts to visualize data. By completing these tasks, you have gained valuable experience in working with Excel and are better equipped to analyze and present data in a professional manner.
